🎬 AI Movies – Exploring MovieLens 100K
Ever wondered how people rate movies? This project takes a deep dive into the MovieLens 100K dataset — a classic collection of movie ratings — to uncover patterns, trends, and a few surprises along the way.

Think of it as a behind-the-scenes tour of how data scientists get to know their dataset before building recommendations or AI models.

✨ What This Project Does
Loads & unpacks the MovieLens 100K dataset right inside Google Colab

Reads multiple file formats (.data, .csv, .xlsx, .json) with smart parsing

Explores the dataset:

First impressions & structure

Descriptive statistics

Data quality checks (spotting missing values, weird entries, etc.)

Analyzes user ratings and movie popularity trends

📂 About the Dataset
We’re working with MovieLens 100K:

100,000 ratings

943 users

1,682 movies

Ratings range from 1 (worst) to 5 (best)

It’s small enough to run quickly, but rich enough to explore meaningful insights.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3

Google Colab

Pandas – for data wrangling

NumPy – for number crunching

(Optional) Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

🚀 How to Try It Yourself
